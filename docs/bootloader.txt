 Bootloader
============

Kern uses a two stage bootloader. The first stage is the 512 byte bootsector. 
This code loads the 2nd stage, which is in the next seven sectors.
Together this whole bootloader takes up the first filesystem block (4kiB).

Bootframe
---------
When the bootloader runs the kernel, it pushes a 32-bit address that points 
to the bootframe It follows the following structure:
* Memory map
* Video memory
* ...todo

It is defined in the libk header 'boot.h'
