=== Project Structure ===

Root contains the Makefile that is used to build kern and some documents.
It also contains these directories:
    src/ - The source code of kern
    include/ - C header files that can be included by the OS. include/c/ can be used by any programs, but other headers shall only be included in the kernel
    build/ - This directory is created by the Makefile and contains intermediary built obj file and binaries
    other/ - Things that are not nescessarly part of the OS
    docs/ - Some basic documentation. Mostly for me so that i don't forget stuff

After running the Makefile and succesfully building the OS a 'kern.iso' file will be created in the root directory
