=== Project Structure ===

Root contains the Makefile that is used to build kern and some documents.
It also contains these directories:
    src/    - Kernel source code
    boot/   - Bootloader code
    libc/   - C Standard library
    libk/   - Kernel library
    docs/   - Some documentation (mainly for me)
    other/  - Things like screenshot, etc.
    usr/    - Userspace files like fonts and programs
    bin/    - Intermediary binaries

After running the Makefile and succesfully building the OS 
a 'kern.iso' file will be created in the root directory
