Kern Dev Struct
===============

Independant Modules
-------------------
* Each MUST have their own directory (eg. 'kernel/', 'boot/')
* Each MAY have their own internal independant submodules (eg. userspace programs in 'usr/')
* A module MAY be dependant on it's own submodules, but it's submodules MUST be independant of each other
* Each MUST have a makefile in their directory (eg. 'libc/makefile')
* Each module MUST be listed in the 'make.defaults' directory
* Each module MUST be self-contained and independentally compilable

kern (Root "module", is dependant on all of it's submodules)
 |- boot
 |   |- bootsect (stage1)
 |   '- bootload (stage2)
 |- kernel
 |   '- libk
 |- libc (C Standard Library)
 '- user !EXCEPTION: Userspace programs are dependant upon libc!
     |- coreutils
     |- fdisk
     |- init
     |- mkfs
     |- sh
     ..
