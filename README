kern.
=====

_Idk why i called it that it was 3am and i needed sleep._

!! WARNING !!
Kern is broken at the moment. The last working commit is: '11feab5'
(https://github.com/Tom-on64/kern/tree/11feab5)

About
-----
Kern is a 32-bit OS based on the x86 architecture written in NASM Assembly and C. 
I'm working on a basic command line as well as a custom unix-esque filesystem.
It has a simple shell with some commands (use 'help' for a list of available ones).

Since there's always more to do, here are the TODO.

Features
--------
* Shell
* Filesystem
* Userspace
* Font support
* Graphics mode
* Physical memory manager
* Virtual memory manager
* System calls
